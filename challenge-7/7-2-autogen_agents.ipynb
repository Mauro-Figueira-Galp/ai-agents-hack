    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a multi-agent collaboration system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. We'll create a Hiring Assessment Team that simulates the technical assessment process for candidates, showcasing role specialization and handoffs between agents.\n",

    "## What is AutoGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen is a framework from Microsoft Research that enables:\n",
    "- Flexible agent-to-agent communication\n",
    "- Multi-agent collaboration patterns\n",
    "- Function calling and tool use\n",
    "- Dynamic conversation orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates how AutoGen can be used to simulate real-world business processes involving multiple specialized roles with proper handoffs."

    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates the power of AutoGen for multi-agent collaboration. The key features showcased include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialized Agent Roles** - Each agent has a distinct role and expertise\n",
    "2. **Agent Handoffs** - Clear transitions between agents with explicit handoff patterns\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration** - Specialized tools for job descriptions, questions, and evaluation\n",
    "4. **Realistic Simulation** - Practical assessment creation process that mimics real-world hiring teams\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting system provides a realistic simulation of how hiring teams collaborate to create effective assessments for job candidates, with each agent contributing their specialized expertise and clearly defined handoffs between roles."
